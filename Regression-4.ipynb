    "### Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumptions of Ridge Regression\n",
    "#Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumption: The relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) is linear. This means that the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable is additive.\n",
    "#Implication: If the relationship is not linear, Ridge Regression may not capture the true pattern in the data, leading to inaccurate predictions.\n",
    "#Independence of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumption: The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other. There should be no correlation between the residuals of different observations.\n",
    "#Implication: If the errors are correlated (e.g., in time series data), the standard errors may be underestimated, leading to overly optimistic confidence intervals and p-values.\n",
    "#Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumption: The residuals should have constant variance at all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals should be consistent across all predicted values.\n",
    "#Implication: If the residuals exhibit heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), the model's estimates may be inefficient, and standard errors may be biased.\n",
    "#Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumption: While Ridge Regression can handle multicollinearity (high correlation among independent variables) better than ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, it still assumes that multicollinearity is not extreme. If multicollinearity is too severe, even Ridge Regression may struggle to produce stable and reliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "#Implication: High multicollinearity can still inflate the variance of the coefficient estimates, although Ridge Regression mitigates this effect compared to OLS.\n",
    "#Normality of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumption: The residuals should be normally distributed, especially important when constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n",
    "#Implication: If the errors are not normally distributed, the confidence intervals and p-values may be inaccurate, leading to incorrect inferences.\n",
    "#No Perfect Multicollinearity:\n",
    "#\n",
    "##Assumption: None of the independent variables should be a perfect linear combination of other independent variables.\n",
    "#Implication: If perfect multicollinearity exists, Ridge Regression will struggle to estimate the coefficients uniquely, although it can handle near-multicollinearity better than OLS.\n",
    "#Mean of Residuals is Zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Assumption: The average of the residuals should be zero. This is generally satisfied if an intercept is included in the model.\n",
    "#Implication: If this condition is not met, it suggests that the model may be biased."
